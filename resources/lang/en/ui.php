    'presentazione'=>'I try to keep every new tattoo project as daring and spontaneous; just like an uncontainable dark joke at a fancy dinner party: not everyone will understand, but who gets it will love it.

    When I start a new tattoo project with a client,  two minds sync and we develop a concept for the body together. Exchanging ideas that will then evolve into a unique tattoo.
    
    Working freehand is a perfect method to preserve the spontaneous nature of this approach, which always results in an unexpectedly more personal and creative experience, for both me and the client. 
    
    I\'m fascinated by dark themes because of the infinite sources of inspiration I can pull from music, movies, personal experiences and dreams. I love sculpting shapes and textures freely but meticulously, which is a never-ending call for improvement. This is also why I don\'t limit myself to a specific set of themes or subjects, but rather use the best of my abilities to develop a unique interpretation of any idea or subject',

    'takeAppuntamento'=>'How do I make an appointment?',
    'appuntamento'=>'Just use this form.',
    'takeConsultazione'=>'Will we have a consultation before the appointment?',
    'consultazione'=>'Since the design process will happen right on the skin, most of the times we’ll both get most of the information we need from the form you’ll fill to book the appointment and few email exchanges. Sometimes though, an in person consultation before the appointment might be necessary.',
    'takeAttesa'=>'What are the waiting times to get an appointment?',
    'attesa'=>'Generally in Vienna and Salzburg waiting times are maximum 1-2 months.',
    'takeTattoo'=>'What kind of tattoos do you NOT do?',
    'tattoo'=>'I’m open to almost any idea and size, but in BLACK only.',
    'takeSessione'=>'
    What can I do to prepare for the tattoo session?',
    'sessione'=>'Tattoos are painful, and even if it’s not your first, don’t underestimate a new placement you haven’t explored yet, and  don’t give your pain tolerance for granted. It’s really important to come to the session well rested, hydrated and after an adequate meal.
    I always recommend bringing whatever makes you comfortable based on the placement we’ll be tattooing (getting a knee/leg tattoo? Bring shorts. Getting a shoulder/arm tattoo? Bring a black tank top, or one that you don\'t mind getting forever sprayed with black ink).
    In winter you might want to bring a blanket, some cozy socks or a pillow. 
    You should also bring some snacks if we’re having a longer session, and some sugary drinks or foods in case you felt like you needed a bit of an energy boost.
    It’s also advisable not to overdo it with alcohol the day before, or caffeine and energy drinks before the session.
    Lastly, a clean and hydrated skin makes for a much more efficient session and a better result, so if you tend to have dry skin, a peeling session a few days before the appointment and  the regular use of skin hydrating creams in the days before the tattoo will result in an easier session for the both of us and a better healing tattoo.

    'takeCity'=>'Where are you based, and where can I get tattooed by you?',
    'city'=>'My home studios are Marda Tattoo Company in Vienna (Austria) and Moksha Tattoo Gallery in Salzburg (Austria), where you can find me every month, but I regularly travel around Europe for guest spots. Every year you can find me in Italy, Sweden, Germany and more.
    If you are interested in getting tattooed by me in a city that you don’t see planned yet, feel free to write to me anyway and i’ll add you to the waiting list.
